# Password Generator

For this project my goal was to demenstrate my ability to tie in functions, arrays and random numbers
to produce a random password generator based on user input variables.

This project features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users will be prompted for:

a password length that they would prefer,

whether to use special characters or not,

whether or not to include: numbers, capital letters and lower case letters.

The finished project shows a useable random password generator that is fully functional and
has real world application.
